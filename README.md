**Project Description**

This project analyzes HR data from University Canada West (UCW) to gain insights into employee applications, program durations, and departmental financial activities. By examining patterns and trends using AWS cloud services, the goal is to identify areas for improvement in workforce planning, resource allocation, and data management. The findings from this analysis will support UCW in making informed decisions to optimize HR operations and enhance overall efficiency.

**Project Title**

UCW HR DAP: Workforce and Policy Analysis

**Objective**

The primary objectives of this descriptive analysis are:
 - To document the end-to-end procedure for ingesting, preparing, and cataloging the Employees-List, Policy-List, and Department-List datasets using AWS cloud services. This process ensures a streamlined and transparent workflow for HR data management.
   
 - To profile and understand the datasetsâ€™ structure, content, quality, and statistical characteristics. This analysis will provide insights into employee application trends, policy structures, and department-level financial activities.
   
 - To generate descriptive summaries and visualizations that illustrate key HR metrics and patterns, supporting evidence-based decision-making at UCW.
   
 - To ensure these foundational datasets are cleaned, well-documented via the AWS Glue Data Catalog, and readily available for integration into more complex analyses within UCW's HR Data Analytics Platform (DAP).

**Dataset**

- Employees-List: Employee records with application dates and program details.
  
- Policy-List: Program names, positions, and durations.

- Department-List: Financial inquiries, payment amounts, and application data.

**Methodology**

- Data Collection: Ingested data from EC2 to S3 using PowerShell.
